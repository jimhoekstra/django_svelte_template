# Svelte Template

Everything in this directory is based on the Svelte template: https://github.com/sveltejs/template, but it has some important changes with respect to this repository. The changes I made to this template are made with the goal of integrating it easily with a Django backend. Please note that the changes I made are entirely my own and are not supported by the developers of Svelte or the Svelte template I linked to in this paragraph or by anybody else.

Please see the Svelte website for more information about Svelte: https://svelte.dev/.
